# Food Folio

## 1. The problem or need Food Folio addresses:
The dining experience isn't just about eating anymore; it's about the overall experience, the ambiance, the quality of service, the unique taste of dishes and drinks, and the stories we associate with these experiences. Most current restaurant review platforms focus mainly on general reviews, ratings, and occasionally, pictures.

There's a gap when it comes to:
- **Detailed, dish-specific reviews**
- **Personal food journey tracking**
- **A consolidated place to record dining experiences in detail**

Food Folio addresses these needs, allowing users to document, revisit, and share their specific food and drink experiences.
