            <h2>Carter-Finley to Feature New Scoreboard</h2>
            <img src="images/ncsu_scoreboard.jpeg" class="left">
            <p>
                Wolfpack fans can look forward to a new and improved scoreboard at home games for the 2023 season. 
                This scoreboard will be featured on the North End Zone side of the stadium for the home opener against 
                the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. This will feature the current Tuffy head logo on the backside of the scoreboard
                for the fans entering into the North gates of Carter-Finley Stadium. This comes after boosters saw issues with 
                the quality of the previous scoreboard that had problems with deteriorating cells that made viewing the 
                screens images tough. This will make the new scoreboard in Carter-Finley the largest in North Carolina and 
                one of the largest in the nation. The state-of-the-art LED display boasts crystal-clear high-definition resolution, 
                ensuring every play, replay, and statistic is visible even from the farthest corners of the stadium. 
                Its immense size and vibrant colors add an electrifying atmosphere to every game, making it a focal point for fans to rally around. 
                This is paired with the new light system, installed last off-season, will make for an amazing spectacle at 
                the beginning of the fourth quarter. This scoreboard is not just an upgrade; it's a game-changer, enhancing the 
                overall fan engagement and enjoyment of events at Carter-Finley Stadium.

                   The Wolfpack started slow to a the opening drive from the Uconn Huskies The Huskies came out early to a 
                   7 - 0 lead. The Wolfpack responded with a drive down the field lead by transfer quarterback Brennan Armstrong 
                   who scrambled the ball down the field. He refused to throw down field, not sure if that was due to his throwing ability,
                   the fact that our receivers couldn't get seperation, or the new offensinve coordinator refused to call any good plays.
                   The offensive line looked horrible and the run game was instantly shut down and the pocket collapsed with every passing play.
                   Armstrong salvaged what the Wolfpack had to offer with each play, willing the team to victory. The defense was carried by
                   vocal leader Payton Wilson who had 10 tackles and ended the game with an interception from Uconn's final drive.
