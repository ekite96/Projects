# Homework 0: Thoughts on Ungrading

## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?

I think this idea is good if the students are motivated to go above and beyond what us expected of them.

## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?

I think it will work well and make for more interesting and diverse projects and ideas.

## 3. On the scale from 1 to 5, how confident are you in that you can earn an A in this class (1 is lowest, 5 is highest)?
