1) I had a challenge getting the following list for a specific user when loading into the homapage to show the posts of the people the user follows. 
    This was because the json object for follows was in a different format and I had to extract the json object twice to be able to run a function to find a specific list.
    This was very time consuming but I was able to figure it out by taking my time and walking through each object that was a creating and understanding that format and type
    of each object.
    
2) I think it would be cool to add support for images in posts instead of just text. This might be chanllenging to format the widerange of images that people post to social media
    but it would be a interesting feature.
